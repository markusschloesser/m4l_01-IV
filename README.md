This maxforlive device can control all the CC parameters for the 01/IV plus the reset features that are available via notes.
Now you can access, edit and automate all the hidden functionality that is not available via knobs.

No patch storage, not (yet) pretty ;-)

Logo only used, so that you can identify the device
