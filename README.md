This maxforlive device can control all the CC parameters for the 01/IV plus the reset features that are available via notes.
Now you can access, edit and automate all the hidden functionality that is not available via knobs.
Includes help texts for all controls. I needed to move the info for LFO Mode from the Ableton INFO view to a pop-up, as the text was too long.

No patch storage, not (yet) pretty ;-)

Logo only used, so that you can identify the device
